    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Predict `ratings_simplified` using the the `review` column only. If there's time after you have a good model working and hypertuned, then you can use `drugName`, and `condition`, columns in your model too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to make a model that scores well on your 25% of the test (holdout) set, without any data leakage. Use `random_state = 123` in `train_test_split`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "- One person from your group will be the spokesperson who will present your results. \n",
    "- Another person is the moderator who will keep the group on task and make sure everything is humming along and everyone is on board with decisions and understands what's happening.\n",
    "- The third person will share their screen and keep the official notebook for the group (everyone should work on their own notebook, too).\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone should have a different role than they had last time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Use GridSearchCV, a pipeline, and any model you like:\n",
    "\n",
    "To grid search with a pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make a GridSearchCV object, put a pipeline with transformers and an estimator in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use column transformers to apply specific transformations to only a subset of columns.\n",

    "You can make as many models as you like.\n",
