# DSI-US-10-DC Week 6 (January 27 - January 31, 2020)

[Week 6 - Advanced Supervised Learning Global Schedule](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/course-info#week-6---advanced-supervised-learning-january-27---january-31)

## Announcements

-   Welcome to Week 6! This week we'll cover advanced supervised learning methods like CART (Classification and Regression Trees), Bagging, Bootstrapping and Boosting methods, Support Vector Machines and Generalized Linear Models and talk about Gradient Descent.
-   This week You'll present Project 3. Same format as previous presentations, as well as deliverables submission.
-   Your **1st Capstone check-in** will be next week. **Make sure to start thinking about your final project!** Capstone instructions can be found in the [Capstone repo](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/capstone), specifically [Capstone Part 1](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/capstone#capstone-part-1-topic-proposals).

## Deliverables

### **Due Monday, January 27, by EOD:**

-   [5.01 Scraping Lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/5.01-lab-webscraping)
-   [5.02 NLP Lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/5.02-lab-nlp-naive-bayes)

### **Due Friday, January 31:**

-   [Project 3](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/project_3) - you will present your work Friday morning. Presentation/slide deck is due **at 10AM**. All of the other [Project 3 materials](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/project_3#necessary-deliverables--submission) (Jupyter Notebook[s] with code and output, executive summary and README, etc.) are due **by EOD Friday**.


    > Reminder: To submit a lab, just navigate to the repo containing that lab on your computer, then:
    >
    > -   `git add .` to add the files to the staging area
    > -   `git commit -m 'submitting lab X'` to commit the files
    > -   `git push` to push your files to your submission folder/repo
