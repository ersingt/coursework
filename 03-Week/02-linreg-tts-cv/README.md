## Lesson Objective

In this lesson, you'll build a linear regression model using guided prompts. You will be exposed to model validation using the train/test split (and K-Fold methods as a bonus) in order to fit different models on sample Boston housing data.

For this lesson, you will be:

-   Creating a train/test split of the data.
-   Training each of your models on the training data.
-   Evaluating each of the models on the test data.
-   Ranking models by how well they scored on the testing data set.
