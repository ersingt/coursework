-   Please make sure you're on the right track when it come to assignments completion - Labs, Projects, Blog Posts and Quizzes. At this point, you should have at least:
    -   Wrote _at least_ five, _ideally_ six blog posts.
    -   Completed 80% (or close to 80%) of all assignments.
    -   Followed and submitted all of the outcomes requirements.

## Deliverables

### **Due Monday, March 9, by EOD:**

-   [11.01 Conceptual Neural Networks Lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-9/11.01-lab-neural-network-conceptual)
    -   [11.02 Applied Neural Networks Lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-9/11.02-lab-neural-network-applied)

### **Due Tuesday, March 10, by EOD:**

-   [Capstone, Part 4: Report Writeup + Technical Analysis](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/capstone#capstone-part-4-report-writeup--technical-analysis) - Document your research and analysis including a summary, an explanation of your modeling approach as well as the strengths and weaknesses of any variables in the process. You should provide insight into your analysis, using best practices like cross validation or applicable prediction metrics. Goal: Detailed report and code with a summary of your statistical analysis, model, and evaluation metrics. **Your code and technical notebook should be posted to your personal GitHub (not git.generalassemb.ly) and linked to us no later than end of day, March 10, 2020.** For more information, check out the [Capstone repo](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/capstone/tree/master/part_04)

### **Due Wednesday, March 11, morning:**

-   Capstone Check-In/lightning talks/dry run presentations - **if your presentation is ready** (not necessarily the slide deck, but you are where you want to be in your Capstones) then please be prepared to present on Wednesday - as a practice run. **Otherwise**, please bring your challenges/pain points/struggles/etc. that you’re experiencing in your project, and share with the class. We’ll do a group “brainstorming” session!

### **Due Friday, March 13, by 10:00AM:**

-   Capstone presentations! **All materials (in the Capstone Repo [including readme, executive summary, codes/notebooks and slide deck in pdf] on GitHub) are due before we start the presentations** (_Friday by 10:00 AM_) - in order to maintain fairness and equal work time for everyone (so the first person to present has as much time to work on their materials as the last person to present) and more importantly, **to respect your classmates when they're presenting.** The order of presenters will be determined in class, by running [this notebook](./Capstone-Project-presenters.ipynb), using a random seed you all will give me. For more information on the presentations, please check out [Capstone Repo - Part 5](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/capstone/tree/master/part_05)

Please use [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com) to submit your assignments. **Don't forget to mark the assignment as 'Done' when submitting!**

    > Reminder: To submit a lab, just navigate to the repo containing that lab on your computer, then:
    >
    > -   `git add .` to add the files to the staging area
    > -   `git commit -m 'submitting lab X'` to commit the files
    > -   `git push` to push your files to your submission folder/repo
