[Week 7 - Big Data & Data Engineering Global Schedule](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/course-info#week-7---big-data--data-engineering-february-3---february-7)

## Announcements

-   Welcome to Week 7! This week we'll cover Big Data & Data Engineering, specifically SQL, Scala and Spark.
-   We're getting into the second half of the course. It's time to start thinking about your Capstone Project! [Capstone check-in number 1](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/capstone#capstone-part-1-topic-proposals) will be this week (on Wednesday).
-   In order to be up to date with the schedule of the assignments, we encourage you to write and submit **blog post number 3** this week.
-   This week is Big Data Week and we'll be working with DataBricks. If you haven't done so yet, **please create a free DataBricks account** - [LINK](https://databricks.com/signup#signup/community).
-   Monday, February 3 will be a Hackathon day - local group project. [Project's repository is here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/Hackathon-Good-Fast-Cheap)
-   Please check the [Client Project repository](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/project-client_project), pick your **top three topics/problem statements** (_at least 3_, you may pick/rank more than that if you like) from [this list](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/project-client_project#problem-summaries) and **[fill out this form](https://forms.gle/FEkhenzv6aN7sZ5f9)**. Client Project presentations and all other deliverables are **due Friday, February 21** (presentations in the morning, the rest of the material by midnight that day).

## Deliverables

### **Due Tuesday, February 4, by EOD:**

-   [	6.01 Supervised Model Comparison](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/6.01-lab-supervised-learning-models)

### **Due Wednesday, February 5, 04:00PM:**

-   Please submit your three capstone proposals via Google Classroom (Check In 1 assignment). Check out the [Capstone repo](hhttps://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/capstone#capstone-part-1-topic-proposals), and specifically [Capstone, Part 1: Topic Proposals](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/capstone/tree/master/part_01) for specific instructions. You will present your ideas on **Wednesday after the PM global lecture**.
-   Goal: Prepare a 3-5 minute lightning talk that covers three potential topics, including potential sources of data, goals, metrics and audience.

### **Friday, February 7, 2:00PM:**

-   Quiz 4 will cover __everything we learned on Week 6 and Week 7 (focusing on SQL but you can expect Scala questions as well).__ 

Please use [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com) to submit your assignments. **Don't forget to mark the assignment as 'Done' when submitting!**

     Reminder: To submit a lab, just navigate to the repo containing that lab on your computer, then:

    -   `git add .` to add the files to the staging area
    -   `git commit -m 'submitting lab X'` to commit the files
    -   `git push` to push your files to your submission folder/repo

## Resources

If you find any relevant or helpful resources, please share them in our [DC Resources Channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T0351JZQ0/CQME38U82)!

### SQL Resources

-   For practice and a deeper dive into SQL, check out the following resources:
    -   [Practice with SQL Zoo](http://www.sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial)
    -   [Database tutorials](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/database_tutorials.htm)
-   For supplemental reading material on this topic, check out the following resources:
    -   [Order of Execution in SQL SELECT Queries](https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_order_of_execution)

### Scala resources

Tis week, we'll be spending a lot of time using Spark on the Data Bricks platform. Spark combines a lot of the functionality we expect from Pandas and Scikit-learn, but it is built to handle big data. Spark is written in Scala, so you may be interested in learning the basics of Scala before diving in to Spark. Note: Becoming familiar with a second programming language is a great skill and a good thing to put on your resume!

-   The [Official Scala Documentation](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/tour-of-scala.html) has a great tour of the language with miniature prompts to run code. This tour begins with a high-level overview of how Scala deals with such things as functions, methods, and classes. You may find it interesting reading, but in my opinion this information is not exactly where I want to begin when learning a new language.
-   This [Scala tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scala/index.htm) also features prompts to run Scala code, but it begins with basic syntax, data types, and variables. You should ignore the information on how to install Scala, and don't worry about moving past the section on collections.
