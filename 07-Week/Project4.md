# Hackathon Project 4 ðŸš€

Pick a tabular dataset and make a predictive model with it. 

## Timeline

- By 11:30am, Slack us what dataset you've chosen for us to okay.
- By 4:30pm, Make your final push to your GitHub submission repo. Make frequent commits throughout the day.
- At 4:30pm, we'll do lightning talks where you'll tell the rest of the class what you found. No slides necessary; you can walk us through your Jupyter notebook if you prefer.

## Guidelines

We know this is a short time for a project. We're not expecting anything as polished as project two or three, for example. However, the goal is for you to have something to show for your time. At a minimum, do some EDA and have at least two models fit and scored.

## Datasets

You can pick any dataset you're interested in. 

Please do not pick a dataset that isn't extremely common in data science examples (such as Titanic, Iris, etc.).

There are many curated collections of interesting datasets online. Here are a few links to get you started:

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [/r/datasets](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/)
- [Data is Plural](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0)

## Check-ins

Slack us the link to your dataset or dataset source by 11:30am so we can okay it.
Slack us your problem statement by 11:45am so we can okay it. 

Reminder: do not duplicate someone else's work.

## Have fun! ðŸŽ‰
