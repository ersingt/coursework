# DSI-US-10-DC Week 10 (February 24 - February 28, 2020)

[Week 10 - Bayesian Statistics Global Schedule](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/course-info#week-10---bayesian-statistics-february-24---february-28)

## Announcements

-   Welcome to Week 10! This week we'll learn Bayesian Statistics. Keep working on your Capstone project and make sure you're catching up with incomplete labs and/or assignments. We **highly encourage** everyone to reach at least 65% completion by the end of this week. Remember, you need to complete **at least 80% of all the assignments** (labs, blog posts and quizzes) - 27 assignments (out of 33).
-   **At this point, you should have at least:**
    -   created and started your Capstone Project repo and initial notebook with EDA done.
    -   Written (at least) three to (ideally) five blog posts
    -   Got close to 65% assignments completion.
    -   Followed and submitted all of the outcomes requirements.

## Deliverables

-   Each team needs to make sure at least one member of the team submitted their team repo for the Client Project - via Google Classroom (as usual) **as well as** through this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/QCFqgUaRuSqYFk1u9).

### **Due Monday, February 24, by EOD:**

-   [9.01 Correlated Data Lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/9.01-lab-correlated-data)
-   [9.02 Time Series Data Lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/9.02-lab-time-series-arima)

### **Friday, February 28, 2PM:**
-   Quiz 5 will be held this Friday at 2PM and will cover weeks 8, 9 and 10.

Please use [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com) to submit your assignments. **Don't forget to mark the assignment as 'Done' when submitting!**

    > Reminder: To submit a lab, just navigate to the repo containing that lab on your computer, then:
    >
    > -   `git add .` to add the files to the staging area
    > -   `git commit -m 'submitting lab X'` to commit the files
    > -   `git push` to push your files to your submission folder/repo

## This Week's Assignments (due next week)

### General Resources

-   [Think Bayes](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/) - this is a great book on Bayesian statistics. Free PDF can be downloaded as well. Specifically for this week, check out Sections 0.2 and 1.1-1.5.
-   [Visual Explanation of Conditional Probability](http://setosa.io/conditional/)
-   As a good resource, check out [**Bayesian Methods for Hackers**](https://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/). It's a notebook-style online book that efficiently teaches Bayesian statistics through some pretty compelling real-world applications. It does a great job teaching Bayesian statistics with minimal mathematical background. Highly recommended. - Tim Book
  -   The GitHub repo for the book can be found [HERE](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers). There's also a [NBViewer version of the book](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/Prologue/Prologue.ipynb).
