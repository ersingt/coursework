# Time Series Challenge with Prophet

By: Jeff Hale

The data file contains hourly electricity usage in Megawatts for several years for the PJM regional transmission organization. DC and the surrounding area gets its power through this grid operating system.

## Goal and Instructions:

### Predict the energy usage for July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017.

- **Use Facebook Prophet only for forecasting**  - you can use pandas and other visualization libraries as needed, but don't make an ARIMA or Holt-Winters model or put the data in Tableau.

- You can make as many models as you like. You can use holidays, but not things like weather data.

- Make the best model possible without any data leakage from dates more recent than June 30, 2016.

- Does your model beat a baseline model?

- We'll have five minute presentations at the end of the session.

We have not used Prophet yet, and that's part of the point of this exercise. As your team works on the project, talk through your decisions about how you approach finding the information you need to help you solve the problem. ðŸ˜‰

### Roles

- One person from your group will be the spokesperson who will present your results.
- Another person is the moderator who will keep the group on task and make sure everything is humming along and everyone is on board with decisions and understands what's happening.
- The third person will share their screen and keep the official notebook for the group (everyone should work on their own notebook, too).

## Have fun! ðŸ˜€
