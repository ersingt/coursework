# Lightning Talks

What: A **5-10** minute presentation that reviews a concept that has already been taught. This presentation should be aimed at a relatively non-technical audience in order to explain what the concept is, a little about how it works, when you would use it, and any benefits or disadvantages worth mentioning. We can film this and make a copy available to you so that you may include this on your personal site, if you like. In order to graduate, you will do (at least) one lightning talk. Some people elect to present more than once!

When: Starting Week 5.

Who: One to three people per week.
