# Attendance

## Policy

We will take your attendance twice a day. First, we will check attendance once the morning lecture begins. If we do not have a morning lecture, then we will check attendance at 10:00 a.m. We will check attendance again once the afternoon lecture begins (usually around 2:00 p.m.)

- If you are in CR3 at 10:00 a.m. and at 2:00 p.m., you will be marked **present** for each period, respectively.

- In the morning or afternoon, if you fail to come to campus at all, arrive more than three hours late, or leave more than three hours early, you will be marked **absent** for that period.

- If you arrive for the 10:00 am or 2:00 pm lectures less than 3 hours late _and if lecture has begun_ you will be marked **tardy** for that period.

IMPORTANT: **In order to successfully graduate, you must be tardy no more than 5 times and absent no more than 3 times.**

## Extenuating Circumstances

**Planned**: Naturally there will be doctor's appointments, parent-teacher conferences, etc. that come up during the course. We strongly recommend scheduling these on days and at times when you will be able to attend as much class as possible. This course moves quickly! The more time you are out of class, the more difficult it will be to keep up with the class.

If you know ahead of time that you're going to be late or that you're going to need to leave early, **PLEASE LET US KNOW ASAP**. While we want to keep missing class to the absolute minimum, there are certain days and times when it might be better or worse to step out. We can work with you to find the least disruptive time to miss. How these will affect your tally of absences and tardies will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

**Unplanned**: Often things occur beyond our control that require one to miss class with little or no notice. From illnesses to funerals and beyond, we understand that these sometimes happen. In the case of an unplanned absence or tardy, **PLEASE LET US KNOW ASAP** and we will be as accommodating as we can be. How these will affect your absences and tardies will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

(Note: Those of you who have lived in the D.C. area for awhile understand that the Metro can be unreliable and traffic can be unpredictable. nevertheless, there are very few legitimate excuses to be late for a 10:00 am lecture. Aim to arrive before 9:00 am every day and not only will you never be late, but you'll give yourself additional time to get work done before the day begins.)
