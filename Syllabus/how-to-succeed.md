# How To: Succeed in DSI
### - Author: Brian Collins; Edited: Adi Bronshtein

During the next 12 weeks, you will often feel overwhelmed with the concepts you are being taught and the sheer number of tasks required of you. That is in the nature of a 'bootcamp' style program. Nevertheless, many students before you have finished the program and moved into rewarding careers in Data Science. Those students who have succeeded have done so by a combination of concentration, grit, and good organizational skills. As a former student and new instructor, here are my recommendations for how to succeed.

## Ask For Help!
You are paying a lot of money to be here, and you should do everything you can to maximize the benefit you get out of this course.

During lectures, make the remote teaching model work for you. This means: never hesitate to ask a question on Slack. Don't feel afraid to ask anything, the instructors want and enjoy helping. The global instructor will address questions from the Slack channel. Additionally, other students and local instructors will chime in with their own answers. The interactivity of this model is in many ways _greater_ than a traditional classroom, but you need to make it work for you.

During lab time or free time, make the most of the connections that you have at your fingertips. You have access to four global instructors, me, and five other local instructors. Schedule one-on-one time with me and with another instructor of your choice. The number one regret I heard from the most recent batch of DC DSI students was that they wished they had asked for help sooner. Whether that comes in the form of 'morning office hours' with me or a weekly Zoom call with a global instructor you need to **be proactive** and ask for our time. We will make time for students who ask for help.

## Show Up Early
Class starts at 10:00 am. The building opens at 8:00 am. Do the math.


## Keep a To-do List

As labs, blog posts, and outcomes tasks are assigned, it will be up to you to track each of them and complete them in a timely manner. Whether you prefer paper-and-pencil, desktop sticky notes, or a fully-fledged to-do list app, you will need somewhere to jot down each task that comes your way for the next 12 weeks.

Personally, I've used [Todoist](https://todoist.com/), and it can be useful. You may organize all your tasks (and sub-tasks) into projects and assign them each a priority level and a deadline. Want to knock out the rest of that neural networks lab over the weekend? Add it to your todoist with a Saturday deadline and you won't see it on your to-do list for the day until Saturday rolls around.
Another option is to use

## Keep Track of Your Labs

On the day that a lab (usually Monday Morning) is due, I will grade it, provide feedback, and submit your grade on Garnet. *I will not keep track of your late labs!* If you submit a lab late, you are responsible to Slack me and let me know that you need it graded.

In addition to a to-do list, Many students find it helpful to create a Google Sheet with every lab on it. In a series of adjacent columns you can then mark whether the lab is: complete, pushed to Github, and marked complete on Garnet. The benefit of this approach is that you may keep an updated tally of incomplete labs and gauge your progress towards the 80% lab completion rate that is required in order to graduate.
