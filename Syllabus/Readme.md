## Welcome to Data Science!

We are building a global community of lifelong learners who are excited about using data to solve real world problems. In this program, youâ€™ll take on real world problems by analyzing data sets for insights and presenting findings using statistics, programming, modeling, and subject-matter expertise.

### What You'll Learn as A Student

- **Data Analysis & Python**:
  - Perform visual and statistical analysis on data using Python and its associated libraries (Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Numpy, to name a few).
- **Machine Learning & Modeling Techniques**:
  - Explore the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning through the application of various modeling techniques such as classification, regression, and clustering.
- **Git, SQL, & Relational Databases**:
  - Gather, store, and organize your data using SQL and Git.
- **Critical Thinking & Synthesis**:
  - Apply your analysis and modeling skills to real world data problems in fields like finance, marketing, and public policy.
- **Visualization, Presentation, & Reporting**:
  - Learn to create reproducible presentations and reports and use data visualization tools to present your findings to key stakeholders.

### By the End of This Course, You Will Be Able To:

- Collect, extract, query, clean, and aggregate data for analysis.
- Perform visual and statistical analysis on data using Python and its associated libraries and tools.
- Build, implement, and evaluate data science problems using appropriate machine learning models and algorithms.
- Use appropriate data visualization tools to communicate findings.
- Present clear and reproducible reports to stakeholders.
- Identify big data problems and understand how distributed systems and parallel computing technologies are solving these challenges.
- Apply question, modeling, and validation problem solving processes to datasets from various industries to gain insight into real-world problems and solutions.
