# DSI-US-11-DC Week 1 (March 16, 2020 - March 20, 2020)

Week 1 - Getting Started: Python for Data Science

## Announcements

-   Welcome to DSI 11 and to the DC campus! We're happy to have you here :)
-   We would like to schedule a 1-on-1 with each of you during the first two weeks, to get to know you better (and let you get to know us better as well). Please reach to us (Jeff and Chuck) and let's schedule 1-on-1s!
-   On Friday we will have Quiz 1. Check out the Assignments section. Once it is posted

## Deliverables

-   **Due Monday, March 23, by EOD:**
    -   [1.01 Pokemon Lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-11/1.01-lab-pokemon)
    -   [1.02 Loot Boxes Lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-11/1.02-lab-loot-boxes)

-   Please submit your work (labs and projects) through [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/). We will go over Google Classroom in class! (see what I did there?)

    > Reminder: To submit a lab, just navigate to the repo containing that lab on your computer, then:
    >
    > -   `git add .` to add the files to the staging area
    > -   `git commit -m 'submitting lab X'` to commit the files
    > -   `git push` to push your files to your submission folder/repo

-   For more Python resources, check out the [Python section](https://git.generalassemb.ly/AdiBro/Resources/blob/master/Python.md) in the resources repo!

### Probability and Statistics

Here are some great visual resources:

-   Brown's 'Seeing Theory' website is amazing. [Here](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/basic-probability/index.html)'s chapter one.
-   [Animation](http://blog.vctr.me/posts/central-limit-theorem.html) of the Central Limit Theorem
-   [Visual explanation](http://setosa.io/conditional/) of conditional probability. More relevant for Bayes week!

#### Probability and Statistics Cheat Sheets:

-   Confused by notation? Check [this](https://www.rapidtables.com/math/symbols/Statistical_Symbols.html) out.
-   VERY exhaustive [Probability and Statistics Cookbook](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~tdw/files/cookbook-en.pdf)
-   Slight less intimidating but still overly exhaustive [Probability Cheatsheet](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54bf3241e4b0f0d81bf7ff36/t/55e9494fe4b011aed10e48e5/1441352015658/probability_cheatsheet.pdf)

### Development Environment (Command Line and Git)

-   [Git - the Simple Guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) - a simple guide for getting started with git.
    -   [Git Cheat Sheet](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf)
