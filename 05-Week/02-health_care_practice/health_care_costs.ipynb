    "- One person from your group will be the spokesperson who will present your results.\n",
    "- Another person is the moderator who will keep the group on task and make sure everything is humming along and everyone is on board with decisions and understands what's happening.\n",
    "- The third person will share their screen and keep the official notebook for the group (everyone should work on their own notebook, too).\n",
