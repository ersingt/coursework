    -   [1.02 Loot Boxes Lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/1.02-lab-loot-boxes)  


-   **Due Friday, December 20, by 10:00AM**:
    -   [Project 1](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/project_1) - **all deliverables** (Jupyter Notebook, Readme, slide deck [as a PDF file] are **due at 10AM**. For more information, check out the [Deliverables section](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-9/project_1). It's also a good idea to check out this [Style Guide](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-9/project_1#style-guide-and-suggested-resources)


-   Please use [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com) to submit your assignments. Don't forget to mark the assignments as 'Done' when submitting!

    > Reminder: To submit a lab, just navigate to the repo containing that lab on your computer, then:
    >
    > -   `git add .` to add the files to the staging area
    > -   `git commit -m 'submitting lab X'` to commit the files
    > -   `git push` to push your files to your submission folder/repo

### General Resources

-   Jake VanderPlas' [**Data Science Handbook**](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) is awesome. This week, check out [Chapter 3 - Data Manipulation with Pandas](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/#3.-Data-Manipulation-with-Pandas)
-   [Chris Albon](https://chrisalbon.com/#python) has a ton of good info. (Repost from last week. For this week, check out the **data wrangling** section)

### Pandas

-   [Pandas cheat sheet](https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)
-   [List of Resources from Data School](http://www.dataschool.io/best-python-pandas-resources/)
-   [Another EDA Tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/exploratory-data-analysis-python#gs.T3TSKbk)
-   [A discussion forum on the topic of EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/general/12796)
-   [More Pandas cheat sheets](https://git.generalassemb.ly/AdiBro/Resources/tree/master/Cheat-Sheets#pandas)
-   [More Pandas Resources](https://git.generalassemb.ly/AdiBro/Resources/blob/master/Data-Analysis.md#pandas)

### Data Analysis

### Data Visualization

-   [Python Graph Gallery](https://python-graph-gallery.com) - this website displays hundreds of charts while providing the reproducible Python code.
-   [From Data To Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com) - ‘From Data to Viz’ is a classification of chart types based on input data format. It comes in the form of a decision tree leading to a set of potentially appropriate visualizations to represent your dataset.

### Probability and Statistics

Here are some great visual resources:

-   Brown's 'Seeing Theory' website is amazing. [Here](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/basic-probability/index.html)'s chapter one.
-   [Animation](http://blog.vctr.me/posts/central-limit-theorem.html) of the Central Limit Theorem
