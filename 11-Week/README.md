# DSI-US-10-DC Week 11 (March 2 - March 6, 2020)

[Week 11 - Deep Learning](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/course-info#week-11---deep-learning-march-2---march-6)

## Announcements

-   Welcome to Week 11! This week we will cover Deep Learning and Neural Networks. Keep working on your Capstone project and make sure you're catching up with incomplete labs and/or assignments. Remember, you need to complete **at least 80% of all the assignments** (labs, blog posts and quizzes) - 27 assignments (out of 33).
-   **At this point, you should have at least:**
    -   created and started your Capstone Project repo and notebook with EDA done
    -   Written (at least) four to (ideally) five blog posts
    -   Achieved close to 80% assignments (labs, quizzes and blog posts) completion
    -   Followed and submitted all of the outcomes requirements
-   This week is Capstone Check In number 3. Check out the Deliverables section!

## Deliverables

### **Due Monday, March 2, by EOD:**

-   [10.01 Bayes Practice Lab ](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/10.01-lab-bayes-practice)
-   [10.02 Bayes Data Lab](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/10.02-lab-bayes-data)

### **Due Tuesday March 3 by 6:00PM:**

-   [Capstone Part 3](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/capstone/#capstone-part-3-progress-report--preliminary-findings): Progress Report + Preliminary Findings - In Part 3, you'll create a progress report of your work in order to get feedback along the way. Describe your approach, initial results, and any setbacks or lessons learned so far. Your report should include updated visual and statistical analysis of your data. You’ll also meet with your local instructional team to get feedback on your results so far!
    -   For more information on Capstone Part 3, check out [this Readme](https://git.generalassemb.ly/DSI-US-10/capstone/tree/master/part_03)
    -   Please use **[this Google form](https://forms.gle/ci7maWp4G5wRHdwH8)** to submit **Capstone Check In 3.** (In addition to Google Classroom!)

Please use [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com) to submit your assignments. **Don't forget to mark the assignment as 'Done' when submitting!**

    > Reminder: To submit a lab, just navigate to the repo containing that lab on your computer, then:
    >
    > -   `git add .` to add the files to the staging area
    > -   `git commit -m 'submitting lab X'` to commit the files
    > -   `git push` to push your files to your submission folder/repo

## This Week's Assignments (due next week)
